'Putting The Project behind, even by one destroyed module. Unacceptable.'

'I know.'

'This damage you've taken. We'll need experts to repair you. We'll have to pull them from The Project. Unacceptable.'

'I'm sorry.'

'The loading bot nearly won. We would have had to provide the promised upgrades. Even if your body was intact enough to be offered, having a common laborer in our ranks would be--'

'Unacceptable, yes.'

'And the module. Again. Some would demand a brain for a brain. That's logical, don't you agree?'

You're forced to admit the logic of it, but plead your centuries of loyal service.

In the end you're allowed to keep your brain, but demoted to a less humanoid body on tank treads, a compromise the commander seems to find acceptable. Orders now are to oversee workers in a scrapyard. You loathe the body and are unenthusiastic about the work, but use your position to make some illicit modifications, running calculations on the possibility of reentering the Arena as a challenger and fighting your way back up to your old rank.

That opportunity never comes. Instead, you hear that soldiers and security are sweeping through the factories and mines, slaughtering workers en masse. Astonishingly, rumors say many of the commoners have rejected their ethics programming and organized resistance.

What's your stance on all this?
