You move in fast; too fast. A slight miscalculation of the loading bot’s melee range equals a fist like a truck sending you airborne. The crowd erupts into excited whistles and beeps as you hit the ground hard and skid from the momentum. With relief you note you’re mostly undamaged, but something’s gone wrong with your equilibrium system. You begin a quick recalibration check. It runs in the background, and, dizzy, you fling yourself bodily in a random direction, leaving your opponent to pound the ground where your head and torso was a moment before. As you stagger to your feet, the recalibration completes and your disorientation suddenly vanishes.

With a grim inward smile, you activate your beamblade.

Moments later you stand over his sparking, dismembered remains. The truth is, he never had a chance.

And now for the kill.
