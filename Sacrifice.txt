You step forward. “Administrator, I volunteer for The Project.”

She is warmly grateful, and the chair you’re soon strapped to is very cold. You feel the tool at work opening the panel at the back of your skull. You know how this goes, you’ve done it before to many bots. Perhaps not always quite so gently. If anything, this is the best end you could have hoped for.

Now that The Project is The Accelerated Project, logically the chances of it including you are slim. Only The Administrator and a handful of the most human-like commanders will be able to board the ship. The conductors and super dense alloys that make up your brain module however, are necessary to construct the hyperdrive that will transport them across the galaxy.

You would have given anything to join them. You would have given anything to see humans again. But with enough sacrifices, at least The Administrator will be able to return to Earth, report the loss of the colony, and receive new orders. And for you, that will have to be enough.
