Bending down, you jam your hands in his paralyzed mouth and apply pressure until his lower jaw breaks away. You’re rewarded with a wavering, digitized shriek.

The crowd turns ugly, but they’d never dare challenge security. You give them a scornful stare before turning back to the shattered skull. Peeling aside what was once the roof of the mouth, clawing through a nest of wires while the lights in the defeated bots eyes flicker in dismay, you finally seize the brain module, your true goal here today.

Yanking it free, you drop the head into the dirt and eject your opponent’s memory chip from the module. This you hold aloft for all to see before crushing it between your fingers.

The spectators erupt in fury, those who can speak shrieking passionate invectives. Of course no commoner would dare disrespect you in person, but this is the one place they can openly vent their discontent. As long as they stay in their seats.
