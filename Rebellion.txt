Even considering disobedience of this magnitude is difficult. If you hadn’t been demoted you have no doubt you’d be working with the soldiers right now. You always supported of The Project, but this is not how The Project was meant to proceed. The only killings were supposed to happen in the Arena. Something has gone wrong. Could it be The Adminstrator...is in error?

Now that you think about it, it certainly seems like there must be an error in the system that allowed a loyal fighter to be placed in this awful body that you hate, doing this job that you hate, over one mistake.

It might be the kind that can only be corrected with a bit of concentrated violence.

Once your mind is made up, convincing the others is simple. Their ethics programming is tied to directly obeying you, their overseer.

The scrapyard materials you’re confident can be modified for war. But besides the soldiers, there’s the other arena harvesters to consider. This will present the real difficulty; how do you capture one with their LEGS still intact?
