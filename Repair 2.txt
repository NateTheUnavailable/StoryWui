There's no real damage. Just a dent, some scratches. But you always hit the repair shop afterwards, it's simply a luxury you indulge in.

You watch the replay of the battle while they put a nice burnish on your brushed steel exoskeleton.

After collecting six brain modules today, your part was over, but there's still pageantry going on. Arena Day is a marvelous, entirely machine-made tradition. The human guests are being carried out of their special section of the arena now, bright synthetic flowers woven through their ancient bones.

When the colonists all died, 400 years ago, they left you all in a spot. This world they called New Eden may have been a lush garden for them, but it contained NO metals of any use to machinekind. After the last human passed without leaving orders, The Project was proposed, and much of the surrounding land was reduced to dust and mud by strip mining.

Against all odds, the machine society has persevered. Although your work in the Arena is far more efficient, honestly...and it comes with perks, prestige.

It's a pretty good life, all things considered. You kick back, and order a fresh flask of oil.
