The lights in the defeated bot’s eyes still flicker dimly.

“It’ll be over in a moment,” you reassure him, kneeling down and using a special tool to pry open a panel on the back of his detached head.

After unhooking a few wires, you carefully extract the baseball-sized brain module, your true goal here today.

Standing, you hold your trophy aloft. The crowd erupts in displeasure. No commoner would dare disrespect you in person, but this is the one place they can vent their frustration.

When the noise dies down, you eject the memory chip from the module, and put it in your mouth. Nudging it into a slot in your inner cheek, you sense the loading bot’s dormant data, and a couple of your own processes beginning to sift through it.

There’s no practical need for preserving the memories of an obsolete bot built for labor, but the gesture has gone a long way to mollify your audience.
