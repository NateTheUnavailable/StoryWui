Use the cover of the thick dust to circle around behind your opponent, then spring onto his back and behead him: that was the plan.

Not being a laborer, you’re already in mid leap before you recognize the beeping much of the crowd has taken up as being their universal signal for look behind you.

The loading bot abruptly pivots at the hips and a fist like a truck smashes into your legs. Warning screens flash across your vision and even before you hit the ground you know one knee is shattered. Your beamblade meanwhile has landed nearby, and you desperately fling yourself in that direction.

One fist pounds the ground where your torso was a moment ago. The other caves in your left shoulder plate, immobilizing the arm. Snatching the beamblade right handed, you activate it in firing mode, blasting a hole straight through the head of the bot as it looms above you.

He collapses. On top of you.

You hear something else inside you snap, while the larger bot goes motionless. You think you fried his brain module.

That’s...not a good thing...
